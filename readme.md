# RNN
Before jumping into what a RNN is we  should undersand what temporal dependency is

## Temporal Dependency
Basically temporal dependency are functions that depend on time.

Say that you are looking at the picture of a dog, the dog might be running standing etc.... the state of the dog depends on time and hence it can be termed as a temporal dependency.

RNNs are neural networks which have temporal depedencies it has knowledge not only about the new dataset it sees by also about previous dataset that it has already seen.
RNNs have memory associated with it which would give it knowledge about the previous information it has learned when it is provided a dataset.

RNNs were inspired modeled loosly on how the human brain works.

Practically RNNs show good performance in time-series datas.
